# 🗄️ SQL Quant Data Engineering Lab

SQL Server–based research database and analytics pipeline  
for systematic trading and quantitative analysis.

This project builds the data backbone behind all strategies:
clean data → structured storage → fast queries → reproducible research.

Software & Server: , DBeaver, Python (PYODBC) & SQL Server 2014

## ⚙️ What’s inside

### 📡 Data Pipeline (Python → SQL)
• pyodbc connection to SQL Server  
• automated data ingestion from AkShare  
• daily stock OHLCV pull  
• ETL cleaning & normalization  
• batch inserts into relational tables  

→ reproducible market data warehouse

---

### 🗃 Database Infrastructure
• local SQL Server deployment  
• schema design for equities & portfolios  
• indexed tables for fast queries  
• production-style storage for time series data  

→ research-grade financial database

---

### 📊 SQL Analytics
• complex JOIN / MERGE operations  
• portfolio holdings aggregation  
• return & PnL calculation  
• drawdown / volatility analysis  
• performance statistics directly in SQL  

→ analytics pushed down to the database layer

## 🧠 Philosophy

Data first  
Storage second  
Models last  

If your data pipeline isn’t robust, nothing downstream is reliable.
